# IBM-Data-Analysis-Capstone
In this project, I assumed that I was recently hired as a Data Analyst by a global IT and business consulting services firm that is known for its expertise in IT solutions and its team of highly experienced IT consultants. In order to keep pace with changing technologies and remain competitive, the organization regularly analyzes data to help identify future skill requirements.

As a Data Analyst, I assisted with this initiative and have been tasked with collecting data from various sources and identifying trends for this year's report on emerging skills.

My first task was to collect the top programming skills that are most in-demand from various sources including Job postings/training portals/Surveys

Once I have collected enough data, I analyzed the data and identified insights and trends.

Each step of the data analysis process is shown in the different notebooks of this repository and some additional files are needed for their understanding.
